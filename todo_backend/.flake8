# Flake8 configuration for the FastAPI Todo backend
# Keep rules minimal and Black-compatible to avoid churn in diffs.

[flake8]
# Align with common Black defaults (choose one):
#  - 88 is Black's default, but many teams prefer 100/120 for APIs.
# Use 100 here for readability without encouraging very long lines.
max-line-length = 100

# Black-compatible ignores:
# E203: whitespace before ':' (conflicts with Black slicing)
# W503: line break before binary operator (Black prefers this style)
ignore =
    E203,
    W503

# Exclude paths that should not be linted
exclude =
    .git,
    __pycache__,
    .venv,
    venv,
    .pytest_cache,
    interfaces

# Only enable per-file-ignores if necessary; keep off by default to reduce noise.
# Example (commented): loosen specific rules for tests if needed in future.
# per-file-ignores =
#     tests/*.py: S101

# Notes:
# - Keep this config minimal to focus on code quality without blocking development.
# - Consider enabling additional plugins (flake8-bugbear, flake8-import-order) later if useful.
